 <!-- The assignment called for a title that was conceise, but also descriptive. I chose this title because "Horiseon" is the name of the company, and "Grow your business" explains what the content on the page is meant for. The title is short enough that it fits inside the tab, but it also describes the function of the page. -->

<!-- I changed div elements to header and nav, to better represent what they do. 
I did research on "span class" as well to see if it should be changed too- I know that span is not semantic. However, I couldn't find an appropriate semantic element tag to replace it, because all it does is make a part of the word a slightly different color. So, I decided to leave it as is. According to my research, it shouldn't affect accessibility. If I am wrong about this please let me know. The other thing I was unsure about was if it was OK to do <header class="header"> or if that was too confusing. So, just to differeciate the element name and the class name, I changed the class name "header" in the CSS to "banner". If this was unnessesary or wrong, please let me know.  -->

    <header class="banner">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>

<!-- I felt the class name "hero" was unsuitable for this project, so I changed the class name to "meetingimage" to better describe the picture. I also moved the image file itself from the CSS to here, and added an alt attribute to improve search engine rankings and accessibility. I considered adding to the alt text as "A picture of..." but an online guide suggested I should leave that part out because it is redundant. If I should have included "A picture of..." please let me know.-->

<!-- There were multiple classes and selectors that did the same thing, so I combined them into 1 class. I changed the divs to sections. I changed some of the CSS names to improve semantics. I also added an id to search-engine-optimization to make the link in the header work. Finally, I added alt attributes to the images to improve search rankings and accessibility. I tried to make my alt attributes as concise as possible. For example, in the first of the three images, I chose not to mention the table, coffee, or notebook because the crux of the image is the web diagram.-->

            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

<!-- I changed the divs to aside and section. I also reduced the number of classes and selectors by changing all the benefit-XXXXXX stuff in the CSS to just "benefit", since they all had the same settings. I chose the word benefit for the individual points, and changed the aside class name from "benefits" to "sidebar". To make the distance between the three paragraphs better match the sample image, I added ".reason p" to the css and margin-bottom: 32px. Under cost management, there was an unnessesary </img> that I removed. Finally, I added alt attributes to the images to improve search rankings and accessibility. -->

<!-- I changed the div to footer. I changed the class name to "copyright" to make it a different name from the footer element. Not sure if this is needed. I also changed h2 to h4 to keep the heading order correct throughout the document. Although there is no footer in the sample image, and the task is to mimic the sample, I was told that this was an error by the person who made the sample image, and the footer was accidentally cut off. So I have left the footer in. -->
