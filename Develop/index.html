 <!-- The assignment called for a title that was conceise, but also descriptive. I chose this title because "Horiseon" is the name of the company, and "Grow your business" explains what the content on the page is meant for. The title is short enough that it fits inside the tab, but it also describes the function of the page. -->

<!-- I changed div elements to header and nav, to better represent what they do. 
I did research on the "span" class as well to see if it should be changed too- I know that span is not semantic. However, I couldn't find an appropriate semantic element tag to replace it, because all it does is make a part of the word a slightly different color. So, I decided to leave it as is. According to my research, it shouldn't affect accessibility. If I am wrong about this please let me know. -->

<!-- I felt the class name "hero" was unsuitable for this project, so I changed the class name to "meetingimage" to better describe the picture. I also moved the image file itself from the CSS to here, and added an alt attribute to improve search engine rankings and accessibility. I considered adding to the alt text as "A picture of..." but an online guide suggested I should leave that part out because it is redundant. If I should have included "A picture of..." please let me know.-->

<!-- There were multiple classes that did the same thing, so I combined them into 1 class. I changed the divs to sections. I also added an id to search-engine-optimization to make the link in the header work. Finally, I added alt attributes to the images to improve search rankings and accessibility. I tried to make my alt attributes as concise as possible. For example, in the first of the three images, I chose not to mention the table, coffee, or notebook because the crux of the image is the web diagram.-->

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
