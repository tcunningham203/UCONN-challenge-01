# Code Refactor Starter Code

List of changes on commits

Commit 01: "Fresh start"
Cloned the files from Xandromus repository using ssh, but after I created a repository on my account and tried to push the files, it said that there were "no changes and the tree was clean" even though nothing had been pushed yet. So I moved all the files out of the folder, then pushed the blank folder.

Commit 02 "first commit"
Moved the files back into the folder, and pushed it. Github now recognized the files. So this is my first offical commit. No changes were made from the Xandromus repository.

Commit 03 "Head and Header"
Changed div elements in the header to nav
Cleaned up the li elements to look nicer
Changed the head title to be a concise, descriptive title

Commit 04 "Main section"
Changed div elements to improve semantics
Moved big image from CSS file to html
Added id to "search-engine-optimization" to get the link working
Added alt attributes to the images
Consolidated some of the CSS classes into 1 class
